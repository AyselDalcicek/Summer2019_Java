		increments (25, 30, 35, . . . , 90, 95, or 100), and the machine accepts only a single
		dollar bill to pay for the item.
		Input: 
		Enter price in cents: 95â†µ
		Output:
		Your change is 0 quarters, 0 dimes, and 1 nickels.
		Remember:
		1 quarter = 25 cents.
		1 dimes = 10 cents.
		1 nickels  = 5 cents.
		you will need to use assignment and short hand operators for this task. Good luck (edited)
